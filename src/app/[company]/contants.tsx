      The most common email format for {company} employees is [first name].[last
      name]@[COMPANY].com. For example, Jane Doe would have the email
      janedoe@[COMPANY].com. Other common email formats include
      f.last@[COMPANY].com and first_last@[COMPANY].com. <br />
      <br /> If you can't find a recruiter's email from an extension like
      Apollo, you can try manually entering their names into these 3 email
      formats, then bcc the email to all the potential addresses. An extension
      like NeverBounce can confirm which email is valid.

      Once you're familiar with {company}'s values, you can include a sentence
      or two about how you and your experiences might align with their values.
      Don't force it, you'll have time to demonstrate your culture fit in the
      interview. <br />
      <br />
      But if your experiences align with their values, you can show your
      recruiter that you did your research and could be a good fit for the
      culture. Our template includes a generic sentence on accessibility, but
      you can add another value that may fit you better.
